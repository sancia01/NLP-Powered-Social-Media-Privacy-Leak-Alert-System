# NLP-Powered-Social-Media-Privacy-Leak-Alert-System
This project implements a system for detecting potential privacy leaks in social media posts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It analyzes the text content of posts and classifies them as potential privacy leaks or safe, allowing users to avoid unintentionally sharing sensitive information.

#Project Workflow

Data Collection: A dataset of social media posts with labels indicating whether they contain privacy-sensitive information.

Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop-word removal, and TF-IDF vectorization are applied to the text data.

Model Training: A Random Forest Classifier is trained to detect privacy risks based on the features derived from the text.

Classification: Posts are classified as either "Safe" or "Potential Privacy Leak."

Real-Time Alerts: The system generates alerts when a privacy leak is detected in a post.
